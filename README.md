## Overview

**RacPump turns trading into a real-time coin-pusher.**

RacPump is a project launched on pumpfun that visualizes trading behavior through a continuously running coin-pusher machine. The project operates entirely through real trades and creator fees, with no manual intervention, no preset outcomes, and no hidden mechanisms.

All activity is displayed through a 24/7 live stream on pumpfun, allowing anyone to observe how trading behavior directly drives distribution, buybacks, and burns in real time.

## Core Concept

In RacPump, trading is not abstract.

Every real trade is treated as a **push**.
Every push causes coins inside the machine to shift.
Every coin drop represents an actual on-chain action.

Nothing is simulated.  
Nothing is delayed.  
Nothing happens off-screen.

What you see is what is happening.

## Creator Fee Mechanism

RacPump operates based on pumpfun’s latest creator fee reform.

Creator fees generated by trading activity are handled as follows:

### Distribution
- A portion of the creator fees is distributed to the **top 10 trading addresses**
- Rankings are calculated using a combined score of:
  - Trading volume
  - Trading frequency

### Buyback & Burn
- The remaining creator fees are allocated exclusively for buybacks
- All tokens acquired through buybacks are **permanently burned**
- No portion is retained, redirected, or reused

---

## Coin-Pusher Visualization

To make the fee flow fully transparent, the buyback portion of creator fees is represented visually as **coins** inside a coin-pusher machine.

- Coins moving forward reflect ongoing trading activity
- Coins dropping represent **real buybacks and burns**
- Each drop corresponds to an on-chain transaction
- There is no randomness, no artificial triggers, and no backend controls

The coin-pusher is not a game layer — it is a visual mirror of actual activity.

---

## Live Streaming

RacPump runs on a **24/7 continuous live stream** via pumpfun.

The live feed displays:
- Trading-driven pushes
- Coin movements
- Distribution events
- Buyback executions
- Token burns

All processes are observable in real time, ensuring transparency and verifiability.

---

## What RacPump Is Not

- No yield promises
- No profit guarantees
- No preset growth paths
- No manual intervention
- No hidden controls

RacPump does not attempt to optimize outcomes or influence results.

It only responds to trading behavior.

---

## Design Philosophy

RacPump is built around three principles:

1. **Behavior Drives Everything**  
   Trading activity is the sole input.

2. **Visibility Over Abstraction**  
   All mechanisms are exposed visually.

3. **No Intervention**  
   The system runs as defined, without adjustment or interference.

---

## Summary

RacPump transforms trading into a continuously operating, transparent system where:

- Trades become pushes  
- Fees become coins  
- Drops become buybacks  
- Buybacks become burns  

All of it happens live.
