## What is UnMolt?

**UnMolt** is an upgraded evolution of Moltbot.

It is an autonomous agent designed to operate safely, transparently, and adaptively in real environments.

Where first-generation agents focused on execution, UnMolt focuses on **consequences**.

UnMolt doesn’t just act — it observes, evaluates, and adjusts.

---

## Why UnMolt Exists

The rise of always-on autonomous agents revealed a fundamental problem:

Power scaled faster than structure.

Agents with broad permissions, opaque decision paths, and no feedback loop between action and outcome may function in demos, but become fragile over time.

UnMolt was started to address this gap.

Not by adding more prompts.
Not by upgrading models.

But by redesigning how autonomy itself works.

## Core Principles

### Permission-First

UnMolt operates with explicit, layered permissions. No blind access. No silent escalation.

### Observable Actions

Every action has a traceable reason. Decisions are visible, inspectable, and auditable.

### Outcome-Aware Learning

Actions are evaluated by results. Success and failure directly influence future behavior.

### Adaptive Autonomy

UnMolt evolves through behavior, not version upgrades.

---

## How UnMolt Is Different

Moltbot executes tasks.

UnMolt understands consequences.

Instead of optimizing for speed or volume, UnMolt optimizes for survivability, consistency, and long-term coherence.

This makes UnMolt suitable for environments where mistakes matter.

---

## Symbolism

UnMolt is represented by a squid.

Unlike creatures that must shed a shell to grow, the squid survives through adaptation.

No rigid form.
No forced upgrades.

Only awareness of the environment and the ability to respond.

---

## Status

UnMolt is an active, evolving project.

Expect iteration, experimentation, and visible change.

Autonomy is not a feature.
It is a responsibility.
