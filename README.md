## Overview

**ChainMon** brings the evolution concept of Pokémon on-chain.

In the first phase, our main character will be **Piplup**, a cute penguin Pokémon.

There is only one ChainMon in the project. It owns its own wallet and trades in real crypto markets using creator fees. There is no user control and no predefined path. Its evolution is determined entirely by its trading behavior — how it takes risk, how it holds positions, and how it survives market volatility.

There are no levels, feeding mechanics, or profit promises. Evolution is not a reward, but a natural outcome of its trading decisions. It may grow, regress, or even disappear.

**We simply place it in the market and observe.**

---

## How It Works

- One autonomous on-chain entity  
- One independent wallet  
- Funded exclusively by creator fees  
- Real trades executed on-chain  
- No external deposits or manual intervention  

Every trade leaves a trace. Every decision affects its state.

## Evolution

There are no levels, experience points, or feeding mechanics.

Evolution is not a reward. It is the natural outcome of accumulated behavior over time.

The organism may:
- Grow
- Regress
- Mutate
- Or disappear

There are no resets.

## Rules

```
[ RULES ]
1. There is only one ChainMon. No resets.
2. The market decides. No one else does.
3. Creator fees are fuel, not protection.
4. Evolution reflects behavior, not success.
5. Failure is allowed. Observation continues.
```
