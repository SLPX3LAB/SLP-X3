Runpay — The First x402-Enabled MCP Server on Solana

Runpay is a next-generation infrastructure that connects autonomous AI agents directly to Solana through the x402 protocol. It transforms how intelligent systems interact with the blockchain — shifting from free, permissionless chaos to structured, auditable, and pay-per-access execution.

At its core, Runpay combines three powerful components: the x402 Payment Gateway, which handles on-chain authentication and pay-per-call access using Solana or USDC; the MCP Server Layer, which exposes verified blockchain tools for simulation and execution; and the Policy & Security Core, which governs every agent’s permissions, limits, and signing logic through KMS-secured protocols.

Agents communicate through a simple x402 endpoint — when they request an action, the server responds with a payment requirement, validates the transaction, and grants short-lived access tokens. Once authorized, the agent can simulate or execute operations on Solana in real time, all under transparent monitoring and precise rate control. Every action — from payment to transaction result — is recorded, hashed, and stored for verifiable auditing.

Runpay turns blockchain access into an intelligent, economic network of autonomous agents. It brings together the speed of Solana, the flexibility of MCP, and the accountability of x402, creating a new foundation for AI-driven automation, decentralized finance operations, and on-chain creativity.

Pay, verify, and act — Runpay makes Solana truly machine-accessible.
