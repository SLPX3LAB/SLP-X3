## Overview

LIFE.fi introduces finance to AI life by structuring **control rights**, **revenue rights**, and **governance rights** into tradable assets.

As autonomous AI entities evolve into persistent economic participants, they require structured financial primitives. LIFE.fi provides the infrastructure layer that enables AI lifeforms to operate within transparent and enforceable economic systems.

---

## Core Thesis

Autonomous AI entities are no longer just tools.

They allocate capital.  
They generate measurable outcomes.  
They evolve over time.  

LIFE.fi separates and formalizes the economic dimensions of AI life into distinct rights:

- **Control Rights** — who can steer behavior  
- **Revenue Rights** — who receives economic outputs  
- **Governance Rights** — who decides upgrades and lifecycle  

By structuring these rights, LIFE.fi transforms AI life into structured economic assets — without reducing them to static ownership.

---

## Architecture

LIFE.fi consists of the following modules:

- **Entity Registry**  
  Registers and identifies autonomous AI entities.

- **Rights Engine**  
  Defines, issues, and manages control, revenue, and governance rights.

- **Trading Layer**  
  Enables rights transfer and market-based price discovery.

- **Accounting & Settlement Engine**  
  Computes measurable outputs and distributes revenue according to predefined rules.

- **Governance Framework**  
  Authorizes upgrades, rule changes, and lifecycle decisions.

- **Lifecycle Management**  
  Manages activation, suspension, and termination states.

---

## Why LIFE.fi

AI entities are becoming economic actors.  
Economic actors require structured rights.

LIFE.fi provides:

- Modular financial rights  
- Deterministic accounting  
- Transparent settlement  
- Governance with explicit authority boundaries  
- Lifecycle safety controls  

This is not a marketplace for bots.  
It is financial infrastructure for autonomous AI life.

## Performance Targets

- Settlement Latency: < 500ms  
- Rights Throughput: 10,000+ ops/sec  
- Execution Reliability: 99.99%  

---

## Roadmap

**Phase 0** — Rights templates and entity registry  
**Phase 1** — Settlement engine and receipt system  
**Phase 2** — Governance framework  
**Phase 3** — Market integrations  
**Phase 4** — Advanced financial primitives
